**A good demo can make or break your startup. It captivates investors, attracts customers, and generates buzz. Here's how to build demos that actually work.**

---

## ✅ Good Demo vs ❌ Bad Demo
**✅ Good Demo: Tells a Story**
- Has a clear main character (your user) with a problem.  
- The product solves it and saves the day.  
- Every step is necessary to move from **problem ➝ solution**.  
- Leaves the audience satisfied and inspired.

**❌ Bad Demo: Gives a Tour**
- Moves exhaustively from feature to feature.  
- Lacks clear narrative or user perspective.  
- Focuses on irrelevant or generic features.  
- Leaves the audience confused and bored.
---
**✅ Good Demo: Has a Magic Moment**
- Surprises the audience with **power + elegance**.  
- Creates a moment people **talk about**.  
- Drives conviction to **buy**.

**❌ Bad Demo: Forgettable** 
- Reasonable but not exciting.  
- Doesn’t leave a lasting impression.
---
**✅ Good Demo: Believable**  
- Assumes audience is skeptical.  
- Explains how things work with just enough detail.  
- Impresses because it **feels real** and **pulled off well**.

**❌ Bad Demo: Feels Fake**

---

**✅ Good Demo: Tailored to the Audience**

- Feels personalized and thoughtful.  
- Connects deeply with the audience’s world.

**❌ Bad Demo: Generic** 
- Filled with acronyms and buzzwords.  
- Uses placeholder assets and dummy data.  
- Looks like every other demo.

---

- Checks in with audience frequently.  
- Encourages questions and discussion.

**❌ Bad Demo: Dry & One-Sided** 
- Presenter lacks energy.  
- Pushes forward regardless of audience engagement.

---

**✅ Good Demo: Ready Instantly** 
- Can be spun up in seconds.  
- Easy to repeat across your team or customers.  
- Minimal setup and friction.

**❌ Bad Demo: Fragile & Tedious**

- Only works on your laptop.  
- Often breaks mid-way.

## 🛠️ How to Deliver a Great Demo

- **Explain the main character** — clarify the role you're playing and the problem you're solving.  
- **Practice end-to-end** — record yourself (e.g. with [Tella.tv](https://tella.tv)) and refine.  
- **Rehearse with others** — teammates, YC partners, or early users.  
- **Automate prep** — use realistic, tailored data for different personas/verticals.  
- **Avoid lorem ipsum** — fake text breaks immersion. Use realistic content.  
- **Use a good mic** — audio quality matters, especially over Zoom.  
- **Jokes are fine**, but only if they don’t sacrifice clarity or realism.  
- **Show, then tell** — demo the magic first, explain it after.

> 🧠 Remember: A great demo isn’t just a walkthrough — it’s a **story**, a **connection**, and a **conversion engine**.
