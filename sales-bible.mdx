Your time is gold. Demo Day is close. Here's how to sell smarter, not harder.

---

## ⏱️ Pre-Discovery

- **Reply fast** to all inbound (within 1 hour). Speed = trust.  
- **Disqualify fast**. No qualified interest? No call.  
- It's better to have **0 calls than 10 useless ones**.

---

## 🕵️ Discovery Call

- **Start with an icebreaker** (8–10% of the call) — build the vibe.  
- **Genuinely care** about your prospect’s pain.  
- **Be human**, not a robot.  
- Talk time: **You 35% / Them 65%**.  
- **Always end with a clear CTA** (next step, trial, follow-up time, etc.).

---

## ✨ Demo

- **First 50%** = dive into their pain, connect it to business impact.  
- **Second 50%** = deliver a **magical, simple demo** that sparks “wow.”  
- **Never offer it for free** — payment = commitment = signal.

---

## 📩 Post-Demo

- Have **all terms & conditions ready**.  
- **Follow up immediately** while momentum is high.  
- Aim to close the loop fast.
