$$
\frac{\text{Dream} * \text{Your Sale Level}}{\text{Time invested} \times \text{Efforts}}
$$

**Breaking down the equation:**

- **Dream:** How compelling and significant your product's impact is on your prospect's goals.
- **Your Sale Level:** Your effectiveness in clearly and confidently communicating value.
- **Time Invested:** The perceived time your prospect believes is needed to achieve value.
- **Efforts:** The perceived difficulty your prospect anticipates in adopting your solution.

**Example:**  
Imagine you're selling a productivity software:

- **Dream:** Helps customer increase revenue by $100,000 / year  
- **Your Sale Level:** 90 % effective (0.9)  
- **Time Invested:** 2 weeks (0.5 months)  
- **Efforts:** Low, easy integration, minimal training (Effort Score = 1.2)

**Plugging this in:**

$$
\frac{\$100,000 \times 0.9}{0.5 \times 1.2} = \frac{\$90,000}{0.6} = \$150,000
$$

This number ($150,000) represents the perceived immediate value for your prospect. A higher result means a higher likelihood of closing the deal quickly and effectively.

**What Matters Most in Sales:**

- **Amplify the Dream:** Clarify and quantify your product’s impact clearly (revenue growth, cost savings).
- **Boost Your Sale Level:** Practice clear, confident communication of your value proposition.
- **Minimize Perceived Time and Effort:** Clearly explain implementation simplicity and rapid time-to-value.
