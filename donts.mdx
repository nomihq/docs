**Your time is gold. Demo Day is close. Here's how to sell smarter, not harder.**

---

**❌ Don'ts for Closing Deals:**

- **Don’t oversell features:** Avoid overwhelming the prospect with irrelevant details.
- **Don’t interrupt or rush:** Give prospects time to voice their concerns fully.
- **Don’t skip qualifying:** Always confirm genuine buying intent first.
- **Don’t ignore objections:** Tackle them openly to maintain credibility.
- **Don’t use unclear language:** Steer clear of jargon. Clarity drives conversion.
- **Don’t end vaguely:** Never close calls without defining clear next steps.
- **Don’t undervalue your product:** Avoid unnecessary discounts. Emphasize value instead.
- **Don’t lose control of the call:** Always guide discussions back to the core problem and your solution.
