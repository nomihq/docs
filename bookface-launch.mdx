**What we built:**
- A **Realtime AI Agent** listening to Zoom calls
- Generating **phrase suggestions** based on prospect
- **Drag and drop** your sales playbook.

**üéÅ Our gift for YC Founders:**

Too many founders wing sales. Every call is a guess, every mistake a missed opportunity.

We wanted to fix that.

We worked on a battle-tested sales doc designed to help you crush discovery calls, close faster, and grow your pipeline with confidence.

**We give you access** to all of Nomi‚Äôs private knowledge base **100% for free(!):**
- **$3M+ in cumulated ARR** generated by **YC X25 founders**
- **120+ interviews** with sales from **top tier companies:** Hubspot, Posthog, Calendly, Webflow, Deel, Ramp..

Simply **comment** under this post **‚ÄúI want access‚Äù**. 

**For those who are looking for more:**
We opened 10 exclusive spots to help you make your ARR explode **for the Demo Day.**

Be careful, they goes out fast(!)
