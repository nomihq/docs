**Discovery calls are 70% of the sale.**
**Here’s how to turn them into real pipeline — fast.**

---

**1. Ask 11–14 Questions — Not 20**

- Sweet spot: 11–14 questions  
- 10? Too shallow. >15? Feels like an interrogation  
- Be curious, not robotic  

---


**2. Ditch Lazy Openers**

- Don't: “Tell me about your business?”  
- Do: “What’s your current process for X — where’s it breaking?”  

---

**3. Focus on 3–4 Key Pains**

- Don’t skim 10 surface-level issues  
- Go deep on a few critical ones  
- Do: “What are the top 3 challenges you're facing with X?”  

---

**4. Ask About Urgency + Impact**

- Do: “What happens if nothing changes?”  
- Do: “Is there a timeline in place?”  

---

**5. Qualify Budget & Decision-Maker – Later**

- Do: “What’s your budget range?”  
- Do: “Who else will weigh in?”  
- Don’t start here. Build value first.  

---

**6. Keep It Conversational – Skip the Deck**

- No slides. Just talk, ask, listen, adjust  

---

**7. Use Open-Ended Questions**

- Do: “Walk me through how you do X today”  
- Target a 40%-60% talk ratio (you-them)  

---

**8. Always Define Next Steps**

- Do: “What’s the logical next step from here?”  
- Avoid vague endings — **book the follow-up**  

---

**9. Personalize Everything**

- Do: “Saw you just launched in Europe — how’s that impacting ops?”  
- Tailored = trust. Scripts = snooze  

---

**10. Selling to Execs? Ask Fewer, Smarter Questions**

- ~4 big-picture Qs — not 10 tactical ones  
- Do: “What key metric are you focused on improving?”  

---

**11. Proven Frameworks to Use**

- **SPIN**: Situation, Problem, Implication, Need-payoff  
- **BANT**: Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline  
- **MEDDIC**: Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision Process, Identify Pain, Champion  

Pick one. Stick to it. Customize.
