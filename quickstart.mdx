## Hey ðŸ‘‹

We are Swan & Ethan.

Two days ago, after the first in-person Office Hour, we realized that most startups could not reach the ARR goal they had set up two weeks ago.

We woke up with this crazy idea of summarizing the _crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me_ of simple but effective selling tactics.
It's made by YC X25 founders, for YC X25 founders.

In 48 hours, we booked tens of interviews with inspiring founders. We learned from them and distilled the essence of their knowledge, learnings, and advice for you.
**$3.24M+ in cumulative ARR** generated by the YC X25 founders interviewed.

We hope this will help you.
