**Great sellers love objections. It means your prospect is already halfway to becoming your customer.**

---

**1. It’s too expensive**  
💬 *“We don’t have the budget for this.”*

**Why it happens**: They’re comparing to a cheaper solution or haven’t seen the value yet.

**How to respond**:  
- “The real cost is sticking with the current system and losing [deals/time/revenue] every month.”  
- “If the ROI is clear, could the budget be unlocked?”

---

**2. What’s the actual ROI?**  
💬 *“What exactly do we get out of this?”*

**Why it happens**: They need numbers, proof, and outcomes.

**How to respond**:  
- Share a **specific outcome or KPI improvement**.  
- “Our average customer sees a [X%] lift in [specific metric] within the first 90 days.”

---

**3. Can we test it first?**  
💬 *“We’d like to try it before committing.”*

**Why it happens**: They fear being locked into something that might not work.

**How to respond**:  
- “Instead of a blind trial, let’s run a 10-day pilot to show concrete impact right away.”  
- Frame a **low-friction win** to build trust fast.

---

**4. I need to talk to my team / boss**  
💬 *“I’m not the only decision-maker.”*

**Why it happens**: Either they’re stalling or not the ultimate decision-maker.

**How to respond**:  
- “Happy to help you build a compelling case internally.”  
- Try to **loop in the decision-maker** directly.

---

**5. We already use something for this**  
💬 *“We’re covered with our current tool.”*

**Why it happens**: They're using a competitor or internal workaround.

**How to respond**:  
- “What’s currently frustrating or limited about your existing setup?”  
- Highlight your **unique differentiators** or ways to **stack** on top of what they have.

---

**6. What if it doesn’t work?**  
💬 *“Sounds risky for us.”*

**Why it happens**: They’re worried about fit or failure.

**How to respond**:  
- “Totally get it — we’ve onboarded companies just like yours with great results.”  
- Share **proof (logos, testimonials, case studies)**.

---

**7. What guarantees do we have?**  
💬 *“What if we want to cancel?”*

**Why it happens**: They want to minimize risk and know the exit terms.

**How to respond**:  
- “We offer full onboarding, a success roadmap, and clear exit clauses if goals aren’t met.”  
- Be transparent about your **support, SLAs, and terms**.
